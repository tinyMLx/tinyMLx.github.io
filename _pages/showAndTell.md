**We are [soliciting Show and Tell talks](https://forms.gle/ic52HZMqVv4pBrkP7) for our monthly Graduate Student TinyML4D Show and Tell and our annual [SciTinyML Workshop May 6th -10th 2024](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10464)**

## What is a TinyML4D Show and Tell Talk?

Show and Tell Talks can include classroom projects, research projects, in-progress projects, failed projects -- basically any kind of TinyML project! We are particularly interested in work that discuss:
+ Scientific Applications of TinyML
+ Applications of TinyML for the Global South and for Global Sustainability
+ Aggregated “best practice” suggestions for getting up to speed on new TinyML projects
+ Surprising discoveries gleaned from deploying TinyML into the real world
+ Work from early career students and professionals

## Note, up to date Show and Tell information can be found on the Discourse Site [tinyml4d-show-and-tell-main-index](https://discuss.tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/t/tinyml4d-show-and-tell-main-index/1216)
