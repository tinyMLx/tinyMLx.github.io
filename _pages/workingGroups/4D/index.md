We've collected links to free online courses on edX and Coursera to help you get started learning about TinyML. We are also working to collect materials from all courses that teach TinyML to create an easy to access repository of course modules, readings, slides, assignments, etc. To view the current course offerings and materials check out our [TinyML Courses and Materials](/courses/) page!
